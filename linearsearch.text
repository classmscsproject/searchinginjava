Linear Search in Java:

Linear search is used to search a key element from multiple elements. Linear search is less used today because it is slower than binary search and hashing.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Traverse the array
Step 2: Match the key element with array element
Step 3: If key element is found, return the index position of the array element
Step 4: If key element is not found, return -1
